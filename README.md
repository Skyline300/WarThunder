# WarThunder-Lang-Updater
An updater for lang files for War Thunder, written in Scala

## How the fuck do you use this??????
You will need your existing Units.csv file and the updated version file, renamed to UnitsN.csv something you can get from Gszabi99's repository [here](https://github.com/gszabi99/War-Thunder-Datamine).
Run the main file and the output will be in a "UnitsMod.csv" file when it is done. 

## Can you use this for any other file other than Units.csv?
Yeah, but you have to manually specify in the code itself, if you don't know how to you can just change the csv name of whatever you want to "Units.csv", and the same for the latter.
