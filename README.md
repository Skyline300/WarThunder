# WarThunder-Lang-Updater
An updater for lang files for War Thunder, written in Scala

## Usage

You will need your existing Units.csv file and the updated version file, renamed to UnitsN.csv, something you can get from Gszabi99's repository [here](https://github.com/gszabi99/War-Thunder-Datamine).
<br>
Run the file like so: 
```
run 'file path 1' 'file path 2'
```
where file path 1 and 2 are your old and new version files respectively, it can be your absolute or relative path

## Can you use this for any other file other than Units.csv?
Some of the localization files currently do not work with this program. So far I've confirmed it to work with units and units_weaponry.
